🌦️ Real-Time Weather Intelligence Platform
A serverless, event-driven weather monitoring system built on Microsoft Azure that ingests live weather data, processes it in real-time, and delivers actionable insights through interactive dashboards and automated alerts.

📋 Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end real-time data engineering using Azure's modern data stack. The pipeline ingests weather data from external APIs, streams it through Event Hub, processes it using Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks, stores it in Kusto DB for fast analytical queries, and visualizes it in Power BI with sub-minute refresh rates.

Key Highlights
Real-time data ingestion with sub-minute latency
Scalable serverless architecture
Automated alerting for extreme weather conditions
Interactive dashboards with live refresh
